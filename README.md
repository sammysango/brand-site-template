# Summary

this is a proof of concept for a lightweight, single-page web app, aimed at non-technical/non-design native users. The idea was triggered by a few people in the same week asking me how they can quickly workshop their startup's branding.

This is essentially a mockup website landing page, designed to allow quick customisation of a few key parameters, with immediate visual feedback. This _isn't_ intended to be a web design tool, but rather a quick and easy sandbox for MVP brand ideation, and/or to aid early stage designer/client collaboration. 

# React + Vite

This provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
